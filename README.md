## P4: Communicate Data Findings
Use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. Conveying your findings through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations in the presentation.<br>
